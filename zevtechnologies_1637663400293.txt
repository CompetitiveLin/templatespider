Add our PRO Barrel and our fiber optic Combat Sights to your Sig P365XL for the ultimate carry optics package.The Octane slide was designed by founder Al Wolf and is the perfect storm of purpose driven features. From the modern lines to the channels on the top of the slide, The Octane is just hard to not look at.Aggressive slide serrations help with manipulations and create a lighter slide, allowing the pistol to shoot flatter and maintain sight picture more easily during follow up shots.When performing manipulations, the edges and angle of the cocking serrations actually drive the fingers further into the slide to produce a better purchase. Regardless of the environment, you'll find the grip of the Octane to be more than adequate.", "detail_cat": "Home/Shop ZEV/Sig Parts/Slides", "id": "189e0e58783ea7e22129c141d8a47454", "images": ["https://www.zevtechnologies.com/assets/images/products/SLD-Z365XL-OCTANE-RMSC-GRY_10-(Pointing Right).jpg?resizeid=2&resizeh=1000&resizew=1000", "https://www.zevtechnologies.com/assets/images/products/SLD-Z365XL-OCTANE-RMSC-GRY_20-(Pointing Left).jpg?resizeid=2&resizeh=1000&resizew=1000"], "is_deleted": 0, "lastCrawlTime": "2021-11-23 18:29:58", "measurements": ["Weight: None", "Height: None", "Length: None", "Depth: None"], "name": "ZEV Z365XL Octane Slide with RMSC Optic Cut, Gray", "original_price": "441", "sku_list": [], "source": "zevtechnologies", "updated": 1637663398, "url": "https://www.zevtechnologies.com/ZEV-Z365XL-Octane-Slide-with-RMSC-Optic-Cut-Gray"}, "url": "https://www.zevtechnologies.com/ZEV-Z365XL-Octane-Slide-with-RMSC-Optic-Cut-Gray"}, {"detection_infos": ["【sku_list】重要字段不存在！", "【images】字段自定义不检测", "【sku_list.imgs】字段自定义不检测", "【currency】重要字段不存在！", "【video】重要字段不存在！", "【current_price】字段缺少【$】符号！", "【attributes】重要字段不存在！", "【original_price】字段缺少【$】符号！", "【original_url】重要字段不存在！", "【total_inventory】重要字段不存在！", "【care】重要字段不存在！", "【about】重要字段不存在！", "【sales】重要字段不存在！"], "items": {"brand": "ZEV Technologies", "cat": "Slides", "created": 1637663400, "current_price": "467", "description": "This extra long conversion slide allows any Gen 3 Glock 19 receiver to be converted into a Glock 34 length slide when used in conjunction with our Gen 5 G34 Optimized Match barrel.No matter your slide grip location or preference during manipulation, the angled serrations of the Citadel help you maintain grip by naturally moving your hand downward and on to the slide when force is applied.

They are manufactured in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility from a single billet of 17-4 stainless steel to tighter tolerances than factory slides for increased consistency in barrel lockup which improves accuracy.All ZEV slides have our patented optic cut which features posts allowing for more thread area keeping your optic securely mounted to your slide.
