(recommended for ages 2 to 4)Kids are fascinated with the world around them. If you are the parent or caregiver of a toddler, you know that a walk to the park can be extra exciting when a worm or ladybug makes an appearance. We remember those beautiful days of caterpillars and bumblebees quite well, and know that our bug peg puzzle would be the perfect addition to any playroom.Our Better BugsYou have probably seen plenty of bug puzzles in toy stores near you. But if you are looking for a puzzle that is a cut above the average, you landed in just the perfect spot. All of our Kid Puzzles wood puzzles are handcrafted. We design, hand cut, and hand paint each of our puzzles in the same shop where we have been making puzzles for over 3 decades.Our puzzles are extremely durable, and we build them to last for generations to come. We hope that you will love our puzzles so much that you pass them along to friends and family once your children outgrow them, or that you pack them away in a chest to retrieve when grandkids come your way. Other bug puzzles at toy shops are much too flimsy and cookie cutter to be tucked away for your grandbabies. Our puzzles will not only pass the test of time for durability, but each puzzle is so beautiful that you will love passing them along.More About UsWe are parents, too. In fact, we turned our passion for puzzle making into a business when our kiddos were small. Our children have since grown up, and so has our business. Kid Puzzles has flourished and we are tickled that families across the country trust us to make colorful and customized puzzles for their children. As parents ourselves, we understand your safety concerns, and we are committed to safety at the highest level. Each of our wood puzzles is crafted with nontoxic materials and paint. You can feel confident knowing that if your toddler ends up chewing one of our puzzle pieces, you won’t have to worry about dangerous chemicals. The materials and paint have passed lead and other safety tests.We also know that sometimes, especially with toddlers, puzzle pieces go missing. Sometimes, the pieces end up as a snack for your family pet or find themselves permanently wedged under the fridge. We don’t want a missing puzzle piece to ruin your fun! For a few dollars and a bit of information, we will handcraft a replacement piece that fits your puzzle exactly. We’ll ship it to you sooner than later so that you can get back to puzzling.We also love customizing our puzzles, and can add your child’s name or nickname to our bug puzzle, making it a fun and unique gift.

This beautiful puzzle is far better than the other zoo animal puzzles you’ll find in any toy store. Not convinced? Hear us out.How A Zoo StartsEach of our wood puzzles--including this one that features the zoo’s finest creatures--starts out as a design that we create. We’re Marvin and Margaret, the married couple behind this operation. When we create our puzzle designs, we think back to when our children were toddlers. We consider what little ones love, will keep them engaged and playing. We consider what they need to have a happy puzzle experience. For this peg puzzle, we started with a toddler favorite - zoo animals. What little one doesn’t love a roaring lion or stomping elephant? We also chose colors that were vibrant, and include permanently installed pegs so that little hands could grab the pieces more easily. Our designs are carefully thought out, from the very beginning.After the design comes the fun part - the puzzle cutting. We started creating puzzles over 30 years ago, when our children were small, and we still hand cut each puzzle in the same shop that we used back then. We are careful to use only nontoxic and safe materials, so you can relax if your little one decides that a puzzle piece is a great teething toy. Hand painting is the next step. Then we proudly ship your unique creation right to your door.What Kiddos LearnYour zoo puzzle is more than just a toy that your little one will love. In fact, your puzzle has quite a bit of educational value behind it. When your child works on fitting the pieces into the board, he is developing spatial skills. When a piece doesn’t fit and he slowly turns it to the correct position, he develops problem-solving and critical thinking skills. When he can’t get the piece to fit, and keeps working on it without throwing the piece against the wall, he starts developing his emotional intelligence. Puzzles, my friend, are more than you think. Be sure to check out each of our puzzles and pick one or two to add to your cart. You can also customize any puzzle with your child’s name or nickname; this makes a unique and fun gift for a child or baby-to-be.

(recommended for ages 2 to 4)Brrrr! You don’t have to travel to the North or South Pole to find a peg puzzle that can keep your toddler engaged. In fact, you don’t have to go any further than a home shop right in Oregon. We are Kid Puzzles, and we design, hand cut, and paint each of the wood puzzles you see here. While we don’t pick favorites because we love each of our creations, there is something a little bit “cooler” about these polar animals. Admittedly, our puzzle making is much better than our puns.Made Just For YouEach of our peg puzzles starts with one of our designs. We are parents too, and though our children are now grown, it does not seem that long ago when small hands were around our table and trying out our new puzzles. We consider your child, all kiddos really, when we think of our designs. We make our puzzles colorful, engaging, and whimsical. We also strive to make them educational and great conversation starters. For this polar animal puzzle, you will find polar bears, a walrus, a black-footed kittiwake, penguins, and a sea lion, ready to engage your toddler and connect families.Each of our wood puzzles is handmade in our shop, and each one is a little bit different than the next. You can maximize the personalization by adding your child’s name or nickname to the puzzle. It makes a great gift, and your little one is sure to love learning his name in such a fun way.Built To LastOur wood puzzles are built to be durable and sturdy, unlike some of the flimsy puzzles you find in stores. Our puzzles are hand cut and hand painted, using only safe and non-toxic materials. This polar animal puzzle has permanently placed pegs, ideal for small toddler hands who are working on fine motor skills. In order to keep very busy toddlers engaged and in one place, we use bright and beautiful colors. While your little one is working on putting in each of the pieces, his brain is learning critical thinking, spatial, and problem solving skills.When we make our puzzles, we hope that the one that ships to your doorstep will be in your family for generations to come, passed from your home to your sister’s house, from her house to her cousin’s home. We don’t want a lost puzzle piece to cause you to toss out your puzzle ahead of its time, so we would love to cut you a replacement piece. For only a few dollars and a bit of information, we will hand cut your missing piece and ship it to your home before your little one misses it too much.We know that you will love our puzzles, and this polar animal adventure puzzle is a great one for your child to start with.
