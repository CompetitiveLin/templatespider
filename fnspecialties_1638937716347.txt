Its recoil-proof LED and special TIR lens create a versatile, 1000-lumen tactical beam with extended reach, enough surround light to accommodate peripheral vision, and more than enough output to temporarily overwhelm the dark-adapted vision of an aggressor. X400 Ultra’s 5-milliwatt Red laser sight is highly visible and, once zeroed, rarely needs re-zeroing thanks to Nylok® adjustment screws that won’t back out from the effects of recoil. The WeaponLight securely and rapidly attaches to either Universal rails on handguns or Picatinny rails on handguns and long guns. Ambidextrous pushtoggle switching on the rear of the light provide one-finger control for momentary- or constant-on operation; optional DG grip switches (for pistols) and pressure-pad tape switches (for long guns) permit activation of the light without altering your grip on the weapon. Constructed of aerospace aluminum, hard anodized with a Mil-Spec finish, and O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out the elements, the X400 Ultra is a lethal combination of performance and durability for pistols and long guns alike.
