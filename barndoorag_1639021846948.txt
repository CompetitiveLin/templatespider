A perfect compliment to your grain moisture tester equipment. You can install multiple Grain Gauge devices along the bin wall at key levels. Simply let the gauge do the work for you. No more climbing and risking your safety. Simple, dependable grain bin level monitoring! STANDARD FEATURES & BENEFITS: Easy installation Clear visibility: glows-in-the-dark Two times larger than other brands No electricity required Maintenance free Cost effective HOW IT WORKS: Once the material reaches the desired level of the installed Grain Gauge on your bin, the roller portion of the gauge will turn from black to a bright green. The bright green will also glow in the dark at night time. As the material is emptied from your bin and recedes below the Grain Gauge, the roller will automatically change to black. SIMPLE INSTALLATION: The Grain Gauge is installed from the outside of the bin. No bin entry. Simply drill a 1¼ inch hole and insert two screws. It’s that simple. REPLACING EXISTING INDICATORS: Have another brand of indicator on your bins? Did it stop working? Want to upgrade yours to a Grain Gauge? No problem. Simply swap out your old level indicator with a Grain Gauge!", "detail_cat": "Home/Bargain Barn/CMC Grain Gauge Bin Level Monitor |  7600", "id": "e4ed264dcfdc367d254851c87cd7c994", "images": ["https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-n3b7y2xkbc/images/stencil/500x659/products/228/22031/76002520252812529__91251.1629410458.jpg?c=2", "https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-n3b7y2xkbc/images/stencil/500x659/products/228/22032/76002520252822529__44028.1629410458.jpg?c=2", "https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-n3b7y2xkbc/images/stencil/500x659/products/228/655/Grain-Gauge-Box1__67308.1628605905.jpg?c=2"], "is_deleted": 0, "lastCrawlTime": "2021-12-09 11:50:19", "measurements": ["Weight: None", "Height: None", "Length: None", "Depth: None"], "name": "CMC Grain Gauge Bin Level Monitor |  7600", "original_price": "120.70", "sku_list": [], "source": "barndoorag", "updated": 1639021819, "url": "https://barndoorag.com/cmc-grain-gauge-bin-level-monitor-7600/"}, "url": "https://barndoorag.com/cmc-grain-gauge-bin-level-monitor-7600/"}, {"detection_infos": ["【images】只检查第一张图片", "【sku_list】字段为空, 请去网站检查T.T"], "items": {"brand": "Continental", "cat": "Continental NH3 1-3/4\" ACME Threaded Coupler | A-577-B", "created": 1639021825, "current_price": "70.09", "description": "Continental NH3 1-34\" ACME Threaded Coupler | A-577-B Continental Safety Couplings combine a rugged lightweight aluminum casting with a steel insert, insuring strength and reliability for a high flow extension coupling.
