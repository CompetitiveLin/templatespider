They are small and shallow and may be hard to see initially. Fine lines are so superficial that they respond to treatments faster and easier than deeper wrinkles would. Wrinkles form when fine lines are not treated quickly and begin to deepen but can also form in other areas of the face, like our expression lines. By using EGF serums and moisturizers that boost hydration and collagen production you can keep fine lines and wrinkles at bay.Loss of firmnessWhen we are young, our skin naturally produces collagen and elastin that help it bounce back into place and keep it from sagging. As we get older, natural skin aging as well as environmental factors like UV exposure, stress, and pollution, start to degrade the collagen and elastin. As a consequence, skin starts to sag. EGF increases the production of collagen and elastin so it feels firmer and more lifted.PigmentationAge spots (also known as sunspots) are small areas of discoloration that appear on the face, hands, and other parts of the body regularly exposed to the sun. They are caused by the increased production of melanin, the natural pigment that gives our skin its color. The pigment accumulates in certain areas, which means the spots might fade in the winter but will darken as soon as they are exposed to sunlight. Recent studies have shown that EGF can help diminish the appearance of age spots.Our mission is to restore and maintain skin’s natural youthfulness and vitality through healthy, pure ingredients and truly effective advancements in skincare using biotechnology. © 2021 BIOEFFECT All Rights Reserved Worldwide", "detail_cat": "Home/Repair Collection", "id": "1441051eb2b5d9149b25f87ba6199017", "images": ["https://images.prismic.io/bioeffect/adfedbaf-3d13-4821-aef5-1432ea2ba10a_Collection3_Product+page+-+packshots-final.png?auto=format%2C+compress&rect=0%2C0%2C2290%2C1685&w=850&h=626", "https://images.prismic.io/bioeffect/11c32b1f-437d-46e2-849c-3131fbe17d00_Eye_Mask_Treatment_BLOG_PHOTO_1000x830.jpg?auto=format%2C+compress&rect=0%2C0%2C830%2C830&w=850&h=850", "https://images.prismic.io/bioeffect/61e0a5de-8bc1-438b-879c-865ad7968758_30+Day+Treatment_AP_07-2019+%282%29.jpg?auto=format%2C+compress&rect=0%2C0%2C3768%2C3768&w=850&h=850", "https://images.prismic.io/bioeffect/00dfb5df-3c55-426e-b470-728e82a2a47a_EyeMask_11A4248cr.jpg?auto=format%2C+compress&rect=0%2C0%2C3305%2C3303&w=850&h=850", "https://images.prismic.io/bioeffect/513c9798-3840-46f0-be7c-ae81b3b4af08_IG_theme_January+8.jpg?auto=format%2C+compress&rect=0%2C0%2C3754%2C3754&w=850&h=850"], "is_deleted": 0, "lastCrawlTime": "2021-12-29 15:39:06", "measurements": ["Weight: None", "Height: None", "Length: None", "Depth: None"], "name": "Repair Collection", "original_price": "335", "sku_list": [], "source": "bioeffect.com", "updated": 1640763546, "url": "https://www.bioeffect.com/products/bioeffect-repair-collection"}, "url": "https://www.bioeffect.com/products/bioeffect-repair-collection"}, {"detection_infos": ["【sku_list】字段为空, 请去网站检查T.T", "【description】中存在过长的单个字符串！请注意检查T.T", "【images】只检查第一张图片"], "items": {"brand": "BIOEFFECT", "cat": "Prevent Collection", "created": 1640763549, "current_price": "285", "description": "EGF Serum (15 ml): An award-winning, anti-aging serum with Barley EGF to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, boost hydration, and restore younger-looking skin with only 7 pure ingredients.EGF Eye Serum (6 ml): A refreshing and revitalizing eye serum for wrinkles, fine lines, and puffiness.

Dehydrated skin is characterized by a lack of water in the skin, not oil. As we get older our skin is more likely to suffer from dehydration and the best way to tackle it is to use moisturizers or serums that contain hyaluronic acid, which helps to retain moisture in the skin.DullnessHave you ever looked in the mirror and felt like your skin just looked lackluster? This could be a sign that you are experiencing dull skin. As skin matures, its ability to renew surface cells slows down, causing a buildup of dead cells on the surface. As a result, the natural radiance is hidden. It’s important to exfoliate your skin regularly and use an EGF serum that rejuvenates your skin and boosts its natural regeneration process.Fine linesFine lines often indicate the beginning of the skin’s aging process. They are small and shallow and may be hard to see initially. Fine lines are so superficial that they respond to treatments faster and easier than deeper wrinkles would.
